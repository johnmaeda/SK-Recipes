Do this until you meet the token window requirements.\n",

We'll use the OpenAI API to generate the speech, and then we'll use the Azure Cognitive Search API to search for the speech in the text of the Gettysburg Address and break it up into chunks of text and then processed with embeddings. We've asked the GPT-3 model to write a simple text chunking procedure where a specified maximum length of a chunk is given. Chunking is still more of an art than a science, so you can see the result isn't as perfect as we'd like. But this will give you a sense of how a large text file can be processed into smaller pieces of text that get used by an LLM AI model."
