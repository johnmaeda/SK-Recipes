    "\n",
    "1. **Setting up your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Service key.** This lets you use this notebook like a playground of sorts. And you only have to enter your key once to get going — it stores it locally into a file called \"settings.json\" on your disk. 🙀 Be sure to not let that file show up publicly anywhere like on your personal GitHub repo — so please .gitignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Getting a 🔥 kernel instantiated.** With your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI key you can then create a kernel to send instructions to. We've made it easy for you to use either OpenAI or Azure OpenAI. When using OpenAI, it will default to your using the `text-davinci-003` model; when you use Azure OpenAI there's an extra endpoint setting to consider — and in addition you're asked explicitly for the model you would like to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Run a semantic 🧂 function.** Okay! You're ready to give your LLM AI a natural language prompt expressed as natural language. We call this kind of interaction with the model \"semantic\" because it lives in the world of the underlying meaning of the text you give to the model. "
