This repo is a collection of `.ipynb` (aka "Jupyter notebook") files to be run locally with the following requirements:

## 🏁 Prerequisites to getting started with the notebooks in this repo

> 😱 New to GitHub and VS Code? [Beginner instructions are at here.](THE-BASICS.md)

Software that needs to be installed on your computer:

* ✅ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* ✅ The latest [.Net 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) 
* ✅ [Polyglot Notebooks for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode)

When the three items above are installed, this notebook should be formatted nicely with code blocks that have a little ▶️ (play) button next to them. This lets you run the code from within Visual Studio Code and serves as a little playground for your initial Semantic Kernel learnings.

Separate from installing software, you will need to have an API key to access the OpenAI models. 

* ✅ OpenAI key via [OpenAI](https://openai.com/product) or [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quickstart). Access your API key on OpenAI with [these instructions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key), or on Azure Open AI Service with [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference).

### 📘 After you have achieved all the 👆 prerequisites, open the notebooks in this repo from within Visual Studio Code and you are ready to to go!
