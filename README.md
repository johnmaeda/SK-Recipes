## 🏁 Prerequisites to getting started with the notebooks in this repo

> 😱 New to GitHub and VS Code? [Beginner instructions are at the 👇bottom.](https://github.com/johnmaeda/SK-How-Tos#-never-used-github-or-visual-studio-code-before-no-problem-weve-got-you)

Software that needs to be installed on your computer:

* ✅ [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
* ✅ The latest [.Net 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) 
* ✅ [Polyglot Notebooks for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode)

When the three items above are installed, this notebook should be formatted nicely with code blocks that have a little ▶️ (play) button next to them. This lets you run the code from within Visual Studio Code and serves as a little playground for your initial Semantic Kernel learnings.

Separate from installing software, you will need to have an API key to access the OpenAI models. 

* ✅ OpenAI key via [OpenAI](https://openai.com/product) or [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quickstart). Access your API key on OpenAI with [these instructions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key), or on Azure Open AI Service with [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference).

# 😱 Never used GitHub or Visual Studio Code before? No problem. We've got you.

First, here are a few definitions of concepts you will need to move forward:

* "GitHub repo" refers to this web page you're currently visiting [https://github.com/johnmaeda/SK-How-Tos](https://github.com/johnmaeda/SK-How-Tos).
* "Visual Studio Code" is an application that runs on your computer. It lets you edit the various text files that create runnable software systems.
* "Visual Studio Code Extensions" are special "apps" that you can install into Visual Studio Code to extend its capabilities.
* "Polyglot Notebooks for VS Code" is a VS Code Extension — it's necessary for display the various `.ipnyb` files within VS Code.
* "Download the GitHub repo locally" means using GitHub.com to transfer the files being managed for a project to your computer.
* "OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Service key" refers to a secret credential that only you have access to after you've signed up for either service.

Let's go step by step through what you'll need to do.

1. Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
2. Download and install [.Net 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
3. Install [Polyglot Notebooks for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) extension by hitting the green "Install" button. This will launch Visual Studio Code and put it in the right place.
4. Download the GitHub repo locally by clicking on the big green "<>Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP" or by [going here](https://github.com/johnmaeda/SK-How-Tos/zipball/main).
5. Unzip the file and you should have a brand new folder of files.
6. In Visual Studio Code choose "File > Open Folder ..." and select the folder you've freshly unzipped
7. Select the `notebook.ipnyb` that's inside the `00-ez-starter-notebook` folder. It should display like a nicely formatted document.
8. Be sure to have your OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Service key ready. You can access your API key on OpenAI with [these instructions](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key), or on Azure Open AI Service with [these instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/reference).
