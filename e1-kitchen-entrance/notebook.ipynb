    "## 🧑‍🍳 Welcome to the classroom kitchen!\n",
    "\n",
    "You're likely here because you've heard of, or directly seen, the amazing things happening in the AI space using Large Language Model (LLM) AI. The best way to learn something new is to have a hands-on learning experience — this GitHub repo will let you do some of that, we hope. Semantic Kernel (SK) is an open-source project to be intentionally inclusive of folks at all levels of capability so that the productivity benefits of LLM AI can be more accessible to everyone. SK's been created to make it easy for folks to add LLM AI to your app without a deep background in computer programming. If this sounds like you, then you've definitely at the right place.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Building with Semantic Kernel is like cooking 🧂🥑🍋🔥\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the inspirations for Semantic Kernel's conceptual design is the NYT bestselling cook book by Samin Nosrat entitled, [\"Salt Fat Acid Heat\"](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/t-magazine/samin-nosrat-salt-fat-acid-heat-most-prized-possession.html) and star of [the mini-series](https://www.netflix.com/title/80198288) of the same name on Netflix. Nosrat lays out four key elements to all successful cooked meals as carefully integrating:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🧂 Salt: Core and essential\n",
    "2. 🥑 Fat: Rich and full-bodied\n",
    "3. 🍋 Acid: Fresh and zesty\n",
    "4. 🔥 Heat: Powerful and alchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, think of the popular dish \"avocado toast\" and how important the quality of 🧂 salt, 🥑 fat, 🍋 acid, and 🔥 heat can be to that breakfast staple. You need:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🥑 avocado\n",
    "2. 🍞 toast (which is 🔥 heated bread)\n",
    "\n",
    "to satisfy the definition. Plus there's got to be a little 🧂 salt added to the dish to make it taste more desirable, too. And that recipe for avocado toast may be what you've eaten somewhere in the world to satisfy your hipster cred. \n",
    "\n",
    "But when there's a 🍋 lemon wedge available, or the 🥑 has properly been zested with 🍋 lemon juice, it reaches a whole new level in flavor perfection. That's because the smooth flavor of the 🥑 avocado gets kicked up a notch with the zing of the 🍋 acid. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What does 🧂🥑🍋🔥 cooking have to do with making delicious AI experiences?\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Nosrat's special recipe for cooking a great meal, SK has four key elements for using LLMs to cook terrific AI experiences:\n",
    "\n",
    "| 🍽️ Analogue | SK Term | Description of \"Ingredient\" |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| 🧂 Salt | SKILLS | 🧂 Core LLM AI building blocks that can be stored and reused |\n",
    "| 🥑 Fat | MEMORIES | 🥑 Rich contextual info to level-up LLM AI prompts |\n",
    "| 🍋 Acid | CONNECTORS | 🍋 Fresh, realtime data and capabilities for zesty LLM AI |\n",
    "| 🔥 Heat | KERNEL | 🔥 Powerful convection oven of the LLM AI Asks. Watch the temperature!  |\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll always need 🔥 kernel and 🧂 skills to cook with Semantic Kernel. But when you carefully select the 🥑 memories you want to integrate, and add in fresh data from 🍋 connectors something even more magical can happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are \"cooking\" with Semantic Kernel from the app you're building, it's difficult to get your AI recipe just right without some trial and experimentation. Often times you will want to just play a bit in the kitchen to start. That's the point of these these `.ipynb` notebooks — which give you both a reading experience and a coding experience. The text blocks don't do anything; the code blocks do. Essentially, you get to cook and sample little dishes while you're reading. And you can always come back to these notebooks to test out ideas — which after perfected, you can then transfer over to your app.\n"
